[STORY]
{Department of Housing Pt. 1}
Last Monday, the Department of Housing of City of London declared that they, finally, will officially number all the houses on Cross Street. At last we will be able to order food into our office, instead of using The Times' address.
The Department said that, "Despite Cross Street following non-Euclidian geometry, for legal reasons, it had to be done at some point". The numbering process will begin as soon as all of the houses on street are be counted, which may take a while, considering that no one really knows where the Cross Street begins or ends. For this task, the Department has sent an intern, who, on his first day on the job, will have to count all the houses on our street. Poor guy. We will keep you updated on the situation.

[STORY]
{Robbery Pt. 1}
As we all know, our beloved Mr. Milhow nearly had a heart attack, last Tuesday, when he discovered that while he was on his vacation, his shop was robbed. He reported that several items were stolen, as well as his front, and back, doors. And even though the police have started an investigation on this case, they are still trying to find their way onto the Cross Street. We, on the other hand, decided to help our friend, and started our own private investigation.
It was a rainy, Wednesday evening. Everything was black and white, since I was colour blind. I threw my cigar onto the road and headed back to my office. There, on the desk was lying a single file. Milhow. That poor old man. His shop was robbed yesterday, and I got to find that criminal.
I hang my coat and started reading the case description. No clues. The only way I could find who the criminal is, was by driving to the crime scene, where I will have an internal monologue, after which I will come up with a brilliant conclusion and then smile, mysteriously, and point to the criminal, who will immediately try to run, but who gets stopped by the random customer, walking into the shop. After this, I will explain to everyone, the way I deductively solved this case with ease.
I put on my coat, and headed to Milhow's shop.

{Department of Housing Pt. 2}
The Department of Housing has just announced that the intern, who they have sent to Cross Street in order to count all the houses, has gone missing. They have reported that it is the third one this week, so the numbering process may take a while. The last letter, which they received from him said:
"Oh god, this labyrinth just keeps on going. How many hours have I been walking? It feels like days. I don't even know where I am, and every time I ask a local, they just shrug their shoulders. Please, I beg you, send help. I have already written several letters to you, which I sent through the only postal office here that has RIDICULOUS prices. I'm exhausted and alone, and I'm about to cry; please God, help me."
If you see an exhausted, close to death man, who looks like he was once a sane person, then take him home and take care of him, before setting him free into the wilderness of London, where he can finally get back home into the wild world of journalism.
The Department's spokesman, on the other hand, said that are planning a rescue operation, where they are going to tie another intern to a giant rope, and then sent them onto the Cross Street, and, hopefully, find the missing interns, retrieve all of them, by following the rope. They have named the mission "Operation Breadcrumbs". We will keep you updated on the situation.

[STORY]
{Robbery Pt. 2}
I went into the shop. The bell didn't ring, as the front door was missing. There, sitting on his chair in front of a desk, was Mr. Milhow, the victim. He looked up at me, as I came up to him.
"So, you've finally arrived", greeted me Milhow. I nodded. "What can I do to help you?", he asked. I ignored. I walked around the room. Nothing out of place, but what's that? A piece of fur. I took a closer look at it, before picking it up and licking it.
"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?", shouted Mr. Milhow in disgust, but I didn't listen. The fur tasted like feline. Still fresh. I sniffed the air and felt nothing. I came up to a disgusted Mr. Milhow.
"Do you have a cat?", I asked. He shook his head. I rushed through the missing back door, into the side alley, and saw a dark figure around the corner. I rushed, but, alas, when I got to the corner, they were already gone. I looked at the ground and noticed another piece of fur. I immediately put it in my mouth with a second thought. Feline again. I was following a hot pursuit.

[STORY]
{Department of Housing Pt. 3}
We've just received a message from the Department of Housing of City of London, updating us on the operation "Breadcrumbs" situation. They have successfully retrieved two of the missing interns. Unfortunately, the third intern was, reportedly, sucked into the sewer system, to never be seen again. May he rest in pieces.
The two surviving interns described their journey as "purgatory". Here is their story:
"I knew something was wrong as soon as I stepped onto that godforsaken street. The houses, the lights, everything creeped me out, like someone was constantly watching me. Despite that, I continued on my journey, not knowing that it would be the toughest challenge of my entire life.
It was easy at first, just counting the houses, that's all. But then it got weird. The crossways started to appear more often, and most of the turns led to a dead end. Some of them seemed to lead back to the beginning, so I quickly got lost. I wasn't sure which houses I counted and which didn't. For a few hours there were people, very nice and friendly, but very useless when it came to questions. No one seemed to know how to get out. They just shrugged their shoulders. One of them asked me if I was new here, to which I nodded, after which the man wished me good luck.
After a few hours of walking, I started to meet fewer people, which started to get on my nerves. And then, everyone seemed to have vanished. I didn't notice it at first, but then I did. And that was the last drop. I needed to get out of there. I screamed for help and ran around the block, but no one seemed to answer me. After hours of wandering the streets, I saw him. A person. He guided me back to reality."
"I stepped onto the street and I felt so calm, for some reason. After I overcame the first challenge the street offered and managed to navigate through every crossway, I found myself on a very lush street called Helix Gardens. It was filled with greenery, and I soon walked to a very big park. The feeling of calmness flooded every bit of my body, and I just wanted to lie on the grass and not worry about anything. The entire world felt like some kind of dream.
I'm not sure how long I was there, but it was already the next morning when a man woke me up. I soon remmebered what happened and agreed to follow him back into the city. My advice, don't let the park sooth you. It's a trap, from which it's very difficult to escape on your own.".

[STORY]
{Robbery Pt. 3}
I quickly made my way through the shop and onto the street. The mysterious man was nowhere in sight, and despite my best efforts to find him, he managed to get away. Even though I've lost a battle, I knew that we will meet together one more time.
I went back into the shop and told Mr. Milhow the sad news. Poor old man was devastated, but tried to seem optimistic about the situation. He even made a joke, but I didn't laugh. My mind was wandering in the deep corners of my imagination.
It was already night when I got back to my office. I sat down on my chair. Who was that mysterious man with a fur? If he was the robber, then what was he doing in that alley? Was he listening to our conversation? My head was filled with questions that I was unable to answer. But that wasn't the end of our story, oh, be sure...
